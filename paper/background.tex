% I think this section should include an explanation of the types of cookies we looked for when searching for profiling cookies
Global cookies, such as DoubleClick's \texttt{id} cookie, have a globally unique value, \emph{i.e.,} its value remains the same across different visited websites in each \emph{session} (\textbf{NEEDS VERIFICATION: per session, or per lifetime}. 
Ad companies use these cookies to track user through their web and collect information about their browsing habits and personal preferences.

Local cookies, on the other hand, such as the Google Analytics \texttt{\_\_utma} cookie, have locally unique values.
This means that each unique domain that utilizes such a cookie to track an individual user will have a unique user identifier for the entire \emph{lifetime} of the cookie (\textbf{NEEDS VERIFICATION: per session, or per lifetime}.
These kinds of cookies are used by domains to keep track of their own users and their browsing habits pertaining to their website.
