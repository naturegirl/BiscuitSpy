We tested our BiscuitSpy prototype on the an open home wireless LAN with MAC Address filtering as well as on the open Princeton University WiFi network, which also has MAC Address filtering. Due to factory configuration issues, we were never able to capture useful packets from devices on either network. However, we deem our current prototype sufficient for demonstrating the feasibility of profiling a user based on HTTP cookies.
