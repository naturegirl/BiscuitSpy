\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

BiscuitSpy was built as a proof-of-concept tool for demonstrating the feasibility of profiling web users based on HTTP cookies. It offers functionality to capture packets on an unencrypted local network and to filter out HTTP headers which transmit cookie data. The captured cookie data is combined with existing cookie definitions to extract relevant user information. In our work, we showed that captured cookies leak various personal information, such as browsing behavior, location information, username and e-mail address and unique browser identifiers. By aggregating the cookie information from multiple sources, BiscuitSpy can build up a comprehensive user profile.
